As states formed to regulate trade and commerce within their boundaries, market exchange came to dominate. Nonetheless, the practice of gift exchange continues to play an important role in modern society. One prominent example is scientific research, which can be described as a gift economy. Contrary to popular conception, there is no evidence that societies relied primarily on barter before using money for trade.

The author postulates the growth of a \"military-coinage-slave complex\" around this time, through which mercenary armies looted cities and human beings were cut from their social context to work as slaves in Greece, Rome and elsewhere in the Eurasian continent. The extreme violence of the period marked by the rise of great empires in China, India and the Mediterranean was, in this way, connected with the advent of large-scale slavery and the use of coins to pay soldiers, together with the obligation enforced by the State for its subjects to pay its taxes in currency.

However Wever's vision of a \"Ural\" bomber was never realised, and his emphasis on strategic aerial operations was lost.

The air force was not subordinated to the army support role, and it was not given any particular strategic mission. German doctrine fell between the two concepts. The \"Luftwaffe\" was to be an organization capable of carrying out broad and general support tasks rather than any specific mission. Mainly, this path was chosen to encourage a more flexible use of air power and offer the ground forces the right conditions for a decisive victory. In fact, on the outbreak of war, only 15% of the \"Luftwaffe\"s aircraft were devoted to ground support operations, counter to the long-held myth that the \"Luftwaffe\" was designed for only tactical and operational missions.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Wever's participation in the construction of the \"Luftwaffe\" came to an abrupt end on 3 June 1936 when he was killed along with his engineer in a Heinkel He 70 Blitz, ironically on the very day that his \"Bomber A\" heavy bomber design competition was announced. After Wever's death G\u00f6ring began taking more of an interest in the appointment of \"Luftwaffe\" staff officers. G\u00f6ring appointed his successor Albert Kesselring as Chief of Staff and Ernst Udet to head the Reich's Air Ministry Technical Office (\"Technisches Amt\"), although he was not a technical expert. Despite this Udet helped change the \"Luftwaffe\"s tactical direction towards fast medium bombers to destroy enemy air power in the battle zone rather than through industrial bombing of its aviation production.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Kesselring and Udet did not get on. During Kesselring's time as CS, 1936\u20131937, a power struggle developed between the two as Udet attempted to extend his own power within the \"Luftwaffe\". Kesselring also had to contend with G\u00f6ring appointing \"yes men\" to positions of importance. Udet realised his limitations, and his failures in the production and development of German aircraft would have serious long term consequences.\nThe failure of the \"Luftwaffe\" to progress further towards attaining a strategic bombing force was attributable to several reasons. Many in the \"Luftwaffe\" command believed medium bombers to be sufficient power to launch strategic bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The United Kingdom presented greater problems. \"General der Flieger\" Hellmuth Felmy, commander of \"Luftflotte 2\" in 1939, was charged with devising a plan for an air war over the British Isles. Felmy was convinced that Britain could be defeated through morale bombing. Felmy noted the alleged panic that had broken out in London during the Munich crisis, evidence he believed of British weakness. A second reason was technical. German designers had never solved the issues of the Heinkel He 177A's design difficulties, brought on by the requirement from its inception on 5 November 1937 to have moderate dive bombing capabilities in a 30-meter wingspan aircraft. Moreover, Germany did not possess the economic resources to match the later British and American effort of 1943\u20131944, particularly in large-scale mass production of high power output aircraft engines (with output of over least 1,500\u00a0kW (2,000\u00a0hp). In addition, OKL had not foreseen the industrial and military effort strategic bombing would require. By 1939 the \"Luftwaffe\" was not much better prepared than its enemies to conduct a strategic bombing campaign, with fatal results during the Battle of Britain.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The German rearmament program faced difficulties acquiring raw materials. Germany imported most of its essential materials for rebuilding the \"Luftwaffe\", in particular rubber and aluminium. Petroleum imports were particularly vulnerable to blockade. Germany pushed for synthetic fuel plants, but still failed to meet demands. In 1937 Germany imported more fuel than it had at the start of the decade. By the summer 1938 only 25% of requirements could be covered.

The Dornier Do 217 would have been ideal as a land-based choice, but suffered production problems. Raeder also complained about the poor standard of aerial torpedoes, although their design was the responsibility of the Wehrmacht combined military's naval arm (the \"Kriegsmarine\"), even considering production of the Japanese Type 91 torpedo used at Pearl Harbor as the \"Lufttorpedo\" LT 850 by August 1942.

The Condor lacked speed, armour and bomb load capacity. Sometimes the fuselage literally \"broke its back\" or a wing panel dropped loose from the wing root after a hard landing. Nevertheless, this civilian transport was adapted for the long-range reconnaissance and anti-shipping roles and, between August 1940 and February 1941, Fw 200s sank 85 vessels for a claimed total of 363,000 Grt.

However, Raeder and the \"Kriegsmarine\" failed to press for naval air power until the war began, mitigating the \"Luftwaffe\"s responsibility.

The spring 1942 \"Amerika Bomber\" program also sought to produce useful strategic bomber designs for the \"Luftwaffe\", with their prime design priority being an advanced trans-oceanic range capability as the main aim of the project to directly attack the United States from Europe or the Azores. Inevitably, both the Bomber B and Amerika Bomber programs were victims of the continued emphasis of the Wehrmacht combined military's insistence for its \"Luftwaffe\" air arm to support the \"Wehrmacht Heer\" (the regular German Army) as its primary mission, and the damage to the German aviation industry from Allied bomber attacks.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The RLM's apparent lack of a dedicated \"technical-tactical\" department, that would have directly been in contact with combat pilots to assess their needs for weaponry upgrades and tactical advice, had never been seriously envisioned as a critically ongoing necessity in the planning of the original German air arm.

On the front-line combat side of the issue, and for direct contact with the German aviation firms making the \"Luftwaffe\"s warplanes, the \"Luftwaffe\" did have its own reasonably effective system of four military aviation test facilities, or \"Erprobungstellen\" located at three coastal sites \u2013 Peenem\u00fcnde-West (also incorporating a separate facility in nearby Karlshagen), Tarnewitz and Travem\u00fcnde \u2013 and the central inland site of Rechlin, itself first established as a military airfield in late August 1918 by the German Empire, with the four-facility system commanded later in World War II by \"Oberst\" (Colonel) Edgar Petersen. However, due to lack of co-ordination between the RLM and OKL, all fighter and bomber development was oriented toward short range aircraft, as they could be produced in greater numbers, rather than quality long range aircraft, something that put the \"Luftwaffe\" at a disadvantage as early as the Battle of Britain. The \"ramp-up\" to production levels required to fulfill the \"Luftwaffe\"s front-line needs was also slow, not reaching maximum output until 1944. Production of fighters was not given priority until 1944; Adolf Galland commented that this should have occurred at least a year earlier. Galland also pointed to the mistakes and challenges made in the development of the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet \u2013 which included the protracted development time required for its Junkers Jumo 004 jet engines to achieve reliability.

This was partly owing to production planning failures before the war and the demands of the army. Nevertheless, the German aircraft industry was being outproduced in 1940. In terms of fighter aircraft production, the British exceeded their production plans by 43%, while the Germans remained 40% \"behind\" target by the summer 1940. In fact German production in fighters fell from 227 to 177 per month between July and September 1940.

This \"doubling-up\" involved placing two DB 601s side-by-side on either side of a common vertical-plane space frame with their crankcases' outer sides each having a mount similar to what would be used in a single-engine installation, creating a \"mirror-image\" centrifugal supercharger for the starboard-side component DB 601, inclining the top ends of their crankcases inwards by roughly 30\u00ba to mate with the space-frame central mount, and placing a common propeller gear reduction housing across the front ends of the two engines. Such a twin-crankcased \"power system\" aviation engine crafted from a pair of DB 601s resulted in the 2,700 PS (1,986\u00a0kW) maximum output DB 606 \"coupled\" engine design for these two aircraft in February 1937, but with each of the DB 606 \"coupled\" engines weighing in at around 1.5 tonnes apiece.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The early development of the DB 606 \"coupled\" engines, was paralleled during the late 1930s with Daimler-Benz's simultaneous development of a 1,500\u00a0kW class engine design using a single crankcase.

In 1934, after Lagardelle had obtained a position at the French embassy in Rome, he arranged for Le Corbusier to lecture on architecture in Italy. Lagardelle later served as minister of labor in the pro-Axis Vichy regime. While Le Corbusier sought commissions from the Vichy regime, particularly the redesign of Marseille after its Jewish population had been forcefully removed, he was unsuccessful, and the only appointment he received from it was membership of a committee studying urbanism.

Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighborhoods, old as well as new.

The influence of American blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin' Wolf. Tracks were structured around the twelve-bar blues on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically. The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the British, Celtic, and American folk revivals. Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing. The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including world music, and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and reggae, particularly on \"Houses of the Holy\" and the albums that followed.", "qas": [{"question": "what type of music was rooted music rooted in ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "blues"}], "id": "(22, 41, 0)", "distractors": ["studio track", "anxiety", "alcohol"]}]}, {"context": "The material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright. Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.\nEarly lyrics drew on the band's blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs. Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music. Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic. Particularly on \"Led Zeppelin III\", they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music, which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history. These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics. The pastoral fantasies in Plant's songwriting were inspired by the landscape of the Black Country region and J. R. R. Tolkien high fantasy novel \"The Lord of the Rings\". Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s. In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances.", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to musicologist Robert Walser, \"Led Zeppelin's sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant's wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page's heavily distorted crunch\". These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal and they have been described as the \"definitive heavy metal band\", although the band members have often eschewed the label. Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"The Wanton Song\". Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations; as in \"Black Dog\", where three different time signatures are used. Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music. Plant's use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin's vocal technique. Robert Christgau found him integral to the group's heavy \"power blues\" aesthetic, functioning as a \"mechanical effect\" similarly to Page's guitar parts. While noting Plant \"hints at real feeling\" on some of their acoustic songs, Christgau believed he abandoned traditional blues singing's emphasis on emotional projection in favor of vocal precision and dynamics: \"Whether he is mouthing sexist blues cliches or running through one of the band's half-audible, half-comprehensible ... lyrics about chivalry or the counter-culture, his voice is devoid of feeling. Like the tenors and baritones of yore, he wants his voice to be an instrument\u2014specifically, an electric guitar.\" Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum; while Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Led Zeppelin have been widely viewed as a hard rock band, although Christgau regarded them as art rock as well. According to popular music scholar Reebee Garofalo, \"because hip critics could not find a constructive way of positioning themselves in relation to Led Zeppelin's ultra-macho presentation, they were excluded from the art rock category despite their broad range of influences.\" Christgau wrote in 1972, the band could be considered art rock because they \"relate to rock and roll not organically but intellectually\", idealizing the \"amplified beat\" as \"a kind of formal challenge\". Unlike their contemporaries in Jethro Tull and Yes, who use \"the physical compulsion of beat and volume to involve the mind\", Led Zeppelin \"make body music of an oddly cerebral cast, arousing aggression rather than sexuality.\" As such, along with other second-generation English hard rock bands like Black Sabbath and Mott the Hoople, they can attract both intellectuals and working-class youths in \"a strange potential double audience.\" Years later, \"In Through the Out Door\"s \"tuneful synthesizer pomp\" further confirmed for Christgau they were an art rock band.", "qas": [{"question": "what type of metal was played on hard rock band ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Led Zeppelin"}], "id": "(22, 44, 0)", "distractors": ["beatles", "motival", "susan fast"]}]}, {"context": "Page stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had \"light and shade\".

Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and progressive sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs. They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and overdubbed guitar parts. Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre.

The two \"Emperor Cantatas\" (WoO 87, WoO 88) he scored were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s.

Mozart had also recently died. Count Waldstein, in his farewell note to Beethoven, wrote: \"Through uninterrupted diligence you will receive Mozart's spirit through Haydn's hands.\" Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartean flavour.\nHe did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction, he sought to master counterpoint. He also studied violin under Ignaz Schuppanzigh. Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from Antonio Salieri, primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809. With Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with Johann Albrechtsberger and other teachers.

Documentary evidence is unclear, and both concertos were in a similar state of near-completion (neither was completed or published for several years). Shortly after this performance, he arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number, the three piano trios, Opus 1.

There he wrote his Heiligenstadt Testament, a letter to his brothers which records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and records his resolution to continue living for and through his art. Over time, his hearing loss became profound: at the end of the premiere of his Ninth Symphony in 1824, he had to be turned around to see the tumultuous applause of the audience because he could hear neither it nor the orchestra.

Only Archduke Rudolph paid his share of the pension on the agreed date. Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and soon died after falling from his horse. Lobkowitz stopped paying in September 1811. No successors came forward to continue the patronage, and Beethoven relied mostly on selling composition rights and a small pension after 1815.

This slowed work on \"Fidelio\", his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian censor, and finally premiered in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the French occupation of the city.

He later dedicated his Sonata No. 14, now commonly known as the \"Moonlight sonata\", to her.\nHis relationship with Josephine Brunsvik deepened after the death in 1804 of her aristocratic first husband, the Count Joseph Deym. He wrote Josephine 15 passionate love letters from late 1804 to around 1809/10. Although his feelings were obviously reciprocated, Josephine was forced by her family to withdraw from him in 1807. She cited her \"duty\" and the fact that she would have lost the custodianship of her aristocratic children had she married a commoner.

This news stimulated him to write the battle symphony known as \"Wellington's Victory\". It was first performed on 8\u00a0December, along with his Seventh Symphony, at a charity concert for victims of the war. The work was a popular hit, probably because of its programmatic style, which was entertaining and easy to understand. It received repeat performances at concerts he staged in January and February 1814. His renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of \"Fidelio\", which, in its third revised version, was also well received at its July opening. That summer he composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years (\"No. 27, Opus 90\"). This work was in a markedly more Romantic style than his earlier sonatas. He was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the Congress of Vienna that began in November 1814. His output of songs included his only song cycle, \"An die ferne Geliebte,\" and the extraordinarily expressive second setting of the poem \"An die Hoffnung\" (Op. 94) in 1815.

After Kaspar died on 15\u00a0November 1815, Beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Kaspar's wife Johanna over custody of their son , then nine years old. Beethoven, who considered Johanna an unfit parent because of her morals (she had an illegitimate child by a different father before marrying Kaspar and had been convicted of theft) and financial management, had successfully applied to Kaspar to have himself named sole guardian of the boy. A late codicil to Kaspar's will gave him and Johanna joint guardianship.

Today his best-known works from before 1790 are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790\u20131802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from Haydn and Mozart) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a scherzo rather than a minuet and trio; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.", "qas": []}, {"context": "He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work.

This was after he had become frustrated at repeatedly being asked what it would be called, despite the troupe not having given the matter of a third film any consideration. However, they shared a distrust of organised religion, and, after witnessing the critically acclaimed \"Holy Grail\"s enormous financial turnover, confirming an appetite among the fans for more cinematic endeavours, they began to seriously consider a film lampooning the New Testament era in the same way that \"Holy Grail\" had lampooned Arthurian legend. All they needed was an idea for a plot. Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam, while promoting \"Holy Grail\" in Amsterdam, had come up with a sketch in which Jesus' cross is falling apart because of the idiotic carpenters who built it and he angrily tells them how to do it correctly. However, after an early brainstorming stage, and despite being non-believers, they agreed that Jesus was \"definitely a good guy\" and found nothing to mock in his actual teachings: \"He's not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff\", said Idle later. After settling on the name Brian for their new protagonist, one idea considered was that of \"the 13th disciple\". The focus eventually shifted to a separate individual born at a similar time and location who would be mistaken for the Messiah, but had no desire to be followed as such.\nThe script was started in December 1976, with a first draft completed by mid-1977. The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following \"a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in Barbados\".

The very last words in the film are: \"I said to him, 'Bernie, they'll never make their money back on this one'\", teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project.
