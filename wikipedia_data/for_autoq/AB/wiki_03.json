As a consequence \"pluralia tantum\" nouns (lacking a singular form) cannot be assigned a gender. Example with Bulgarian: \"\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0449\u0438\" (\"kleshti\", \"pincers\"), \"\u0433\u0430\u0449\u0438\" (\"gashti\", \"pants\"), \"\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\" (\"ochila\", \"spectacles\"), \"\u0445\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0435\" (\"hrile\", \"gills\"). The characteristic ending \"-\u0430\" of \"\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430 suggests a neuter noun, but there is no way to cross-check it and there are indeed a few masculine nouns using the same ending in their plural (\"\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430 and \"\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430 are plurals of masculine \"\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043a\" \"leg\" and \"\u0440\u043e\u0433\" \"horn\"). However, the endings \"-\u0438\" and \"-\u0435\" do not make any such indications because they are ambiguous themselves: although \"-\u0438\" is the regular ending for masculine and feminine nouns, both are in fact used to form plurals of nouns of all three genders (e.g. \"\u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438, \"\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438, \"\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438 from masculine \"\u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\" \"factory\", feminine \"\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\" \"woman\" and neuter \"\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e\" \"insect\" or \"\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0435, \"\u0440\u044a\u0446\u0435, \"\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435\" from masculine \"\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043b\" \"king\", feminine \"\u0440\u044a\u043a\u0430\" \"hand\" and neuter \"\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043d\u043e\" \"knee\").", "qas": [{"question": "in what case is the gender of a gender distinguished ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "singular number but not in plural"}], "id": "(0, 50, 0)"}]}, {"context": "Other languages, e.g. Serbo-Croatian, allow doubly marked forms both for number and gender.

Al-Biruni writes that the Ardhanagari script was used in Bathinda and western parts of the Punjab in the 10th century. For some time, Bathinda remained the capital of the kingdom of Bhati Rajputs of the Pal clan, who ruled North India before the Muslims occupied the country. According to al-Biruni, Ardhanagari was a mixture of Devanagari used in Ujjain and Malwa and \"Siddha Matrika\" or the last stage of Siddha\u1e43 script, a variant of the \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script used in Kashmir.

His argument is that from the 10th century, regional differences started to appear between the \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script used in Punjab, the Hill States (partly Himachal Pradesh) and Kashmir. The regional \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script evolved from this stage until the 14th century, when it starts to appear in the form of Gurmukh\u012b.

Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Mus\u00e8s, who said that Roddenberry's views were \"a far cry from atheism\". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: \"It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God.\" He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism \"a very beautiful religion. An art form.\" However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a \"substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one\". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act.

Even a mention of marriage in a script for an early episode of \"The Next Generation\" resulted in Roddenberry's chastising the writers. Nicholas Meyer said that \"Star Trek\" had evolved \"into sort of a secular parallel to the Catholic Mass\".

Tales of Gilgamesh's legendary exploits are narrated in five surviving Sumerian poems. The earliest of these is probably \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\", in which Gilgamesh comes to the aid of the goddess Inanna and drives away the creatures infesting her \"huluppu\" tree. She gives him two unknown objects called a \"mikku\" and a \"pikku\", which he loses. After Enkidu's death, his shade tells Gilgamesh about the bleak conditions in the Underworld.

In the epic, Gilgamesh is a demigod of superhuman strength who befriends the wildman Enkidu. Together, they go on adventures, defeating Humbaba (the East Semitic name for Huwawa) and the Bull of Heaven, who, in the epic, is sent to attack them by Ishtar (the East Semitic equivalent of Inanna) after Gilgamesh rejects her offer for him to become her consort. After Enkidu dies of a disease sent as punishment from the gods, Gilgamesh becomes afraid of his own death, and visits the sage Utnapishtim, the survivor of the Great Flood, hoping to find immortality.

Aelian relates that Gilgamesh's grandfather kept his mother under guard to prevent her from becoming pregnant, because he had been told by an oracle that his grandson would overthrow him. She became pregnant and the guards threw the child off a tower, but an eagle rescued him mid-fall and delivered him safely to an orchard, where he was raised by the gardener. The \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" was rediscovered in the Library of Ashurbanipal in 1849. After being translated in the early 1870s, it caused widespread controversy due to similarities between portions of it and the Hebrew Bible.

The narrative begins with a \"huluppu\" tree\u2014perhaps, according to the Sumerologist Samuel Noah Kramer, a willow, growing on the banks of the river Euphrates. The goddess Inanna moves the tree to her garden in Uruk with the intention to carve it into a throne once it is fully grown. The tree grows and matures, but the serpent \"who knows no charm,\" the \"Anz\u00fb\"-bird, and \"Lilitu\", the Sumerian forerunner to the Lilith of Jewish folklore, all take up residence within the tree, causing Inanna to cry with sorrow. Gilgamesh, who in this story is portrayed as Inanna's brother, comes along and slays the serpent, causing the \"Anz\u00fb\"-bird and Lilitu to flee. Gilgamesh's companions chop down the tree and carve its wood into a bed and a throne, which they give to Inanna. Inanna responds by fashioning a \"pikku\" and a \"mikku\" (probably a drum and drumsticks respectively, although the exact identifications are uncertain), which she gives to Gilgamesh as a reward for his heroism. Gilgamesh loses the \"pikku\" and \"mikku\" and asks who will retrieve them.

As punishment for Gilgamesh's cruelty, the god Anu creates the wildman Enkidu. After being tamed by a prostitute named Shamhat, Enkidu travels to Uruk to confront Gilgamesh.

Gilgamesh wanders through darkness for twelve days before he finally comes into the light. He finds a beautiful garden by the sea in which he meets Siduri, the divine barmaid. At first she tries to prevent Gilgamesh from entering the garden, but later she instead attempts to persuade him to accept death as inevitable and not journey beyond the waters. When Gilgamesh refuses to do this, she directs him to Urshanabi, the ferryman of the gods, who ferries Gilgamesh across the sea to Utnapishtim's homeland.

Despondent at this loss, Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, and shows his city to the ferryman Urshanabi. It is at that this point that the epic stops being a coherent narrative. Tablet XII is an appendix corresponding to the Sumerian poem of \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld\" describing the loss of the \"pikku\" and \"mikku\". Numerous elements within this narrative reveal lack of continuity with the earlier portions of the epic. At the beginning of Tablet XII, Enkidu is still alive, despite having previously died in Tablet VII, and Gilgamesh is kind to Ishtar, despite the violent rivalry between them displayed in Tablet VI.

To prevent this, Seuechoros kept his only daughter under close guard at the Acropolis of the city of Babylon, but she became pregnant nonetheless. Fearing the king's wrath, the guards hurled the infant off the top of a tall tower. An eagle rescued the boy in midflight and carried him to an orchard, where it carefully set him down.

Hamilton's book relied heavily on Smith's translation of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", but also made major changes. For instance, Hamilton omitted the famous flood story entirely and instead focused on the romantic relationship between Ishtar and Gilgamesh. \"Ishtar and Izdubar\" expanded the original roughly 3,000 lines of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" to roughly 6,000 lines of rhyming couplets grouped into forty-eight cantos.

The German psychologist Sigmund Freud, drawing on the theories of James George Frazer and Paul Ehrenreich, interpreted Gilgamesh and Eabani (the earlier misreading for \"Enkidu\") as representing \"man\" and \"crude sensibility\" respectively. He compared them to other brother-figures in world mythology, remarking, \"One is always weaker than the other and dies sooner. In Gilgamesh this ages-old motif of the unequal pair of brothers served to represent the relationship between a man and his libido.\" He also saw Enkidu as representing the placenta, the \"weaker twin\" who dies shortly after birth.

This trend proved so popular that the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" itself is included in \"The Columbia Anthology of Gay Literature\" (1998) as a major early work of that genre. In the 1970s and 1980s, feminist literary critics analyzed the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" as showing evidence for a transition from the original matriarchy of all humanity to modern patriarchy. As the Green Movement expanded in Europe, Gilgamesh's story began to be seen through an environmentalist lens, with Enkidu's death symbolizing man's separation from nature.", "qas": [{"question": "who played a radio playing in britain ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Douglas Geoffrey Bridson"}], "id": "(41, 25, 0)"}]}, {"context": "Theodore Ziolkowski, a scholar of modern literature, states, that \"unlike most other figures from myth, literature, and history, Gilgamesh has established himself as an autonomous entity or simply a name, often independent of the epic context in which he originally became known.

Many contemporary authors and novelists have drawn inspiration from it, including an American avant-garde theater collective called \"The Gilgamesh Group\" and Joan London in her novel \"Gilgamesh\" (2001). \"The Great American Novel\" (1973) by Philip Roth features a character named \"Gil Gamesh\", who is the star pitcher of a fictional 1930s baseball team called the \"Patriot League\".

He rebelled against the religious and political authorities by proposing an unusual, uncompromising approach to the Christian faith. He travelled throughout Britain as a dissenting preacher, often being persecuted by the disapproving authorities. In 1669, he married Margaret Fell, widow of a wealthy supporter, Thomas Fell; she was a leading Friend. His ministry expanded and he made tours of North America and the Low Countries.

Christopher Fox was a churchwarden and was relatively wealthy; when he died in the late 1650s he left his son a substantial legacy. From childhood Fox was of a serious, religious disposition. There is no record of any formal schooling but he learned to read and write. \"When I came to eleven years of age\", he said, \"I knew pureness and righteousness; for, while I was a child, I was taught how to walk to be kept pure. The Lord taught me to be faithful, in all things, and to act faithfully two ways; viz., inwardly to God, and outwardly to man.\" Known as an honest person, he also proclaimed, \"The Lord taught me to be faithful in all things...and to keep to Yea and Nay in all things.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "As he grew up, his relatives \"thought to have made me a priest\" but he was instead apprenticed to a local shoemaker and grazier, George Gee of Mancetter.

A constant obsession for Fox was the pursuit of \"simplicity\" in life, meaning humility and the abandonment of luxury, and the short time he spent as a shepherd was important to the formation of this view.

He alternately shut himself in his room for days at a time or went out alone into the countryside.

By 1651 he had gathered other talented preachers around him and continued to roam the country despite a harsh reception from some listeners, who would whip and beat them to drive them away. As his reputation spread, his words were not welcomed by all. As an uncompromising preacher, he hurled disputation and contradiction to the faces of his opponents. The worship of Friends in the form of silent waiting punctuated by individuals speaking as the Spirit moved them seems to have been well-established by this time, though it is not recorded how this came to be; Richard Bauman asserts that \"speaking was an important feature of the meeting for worship from the earliest days of Quakerism.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Fox complained to judges about decisions he considered morally wrong, as in his letter on the case of a woman due to be executed for theft.

In his view, as God was everywhere and anyone could preach, the established church was unnecessary and a university qualification irrelevant for a preacher. Conflict with civil authority was inevitable. Fox was imprisoned several times, the first at Nottingham in 1649. At Derby in 1650 he was imprisoned for blasphemy; a judge mocked Fox's exhortation to \"tremble at the word of the Lord\", calling him and his followers \"Quakers\". Following his refusal to fight against the return of the monarchy (or to take up arms for any reason), his sentence was doubled. The refusal to swear oaths or take up arms came to be a much more important part of his public statements. Refusal to take oaths meant that Quakers could be prosecuted under laws compelling subjects to pledge allegiance, as well as making testifying in court problematic.

From there he travelled to Sedbergh, where he had heard a group of Seekers were meeting, and preached to over a thousand people on Firbank Fell, convincing many, including Francis Howgill, to accept that Christ might speak to people directly. At the end of the month he stayed at Swarthmoor Hall, near Ulverston, the home of Thomas Fell, vice-chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and his wife, Margaret. At around this time the \"ad hoc\" meetings of Friends began to be formalized and a monthly meeting was set up in County Durham.

Garnet and Catesby met for a third time on 24\u00a0July 1605, at the house of the wealthy catholic Anne Vaux in Enfield Chase. Garnet decided that Tesimond's account had been given under the seal of the confessional, and that canon law therefore forbade him to repeat what he had heard. Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, Garnet attempted to dissuade Catesby from his course, to no avail. Garnet wrote to a colleague in Rome, Claudio Acquaviva, expressing his concerns about open rebellion in England. He also told Acquaviva that \"there is a risk that some private endeavour may commit treason or use force against the King\", and urged the pope to issue a public brief against the use of force.", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to Fawkes, 20\u00a0barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16\u00a0more on 20\u00a0July.

On 28\u00a0July, the ever-present threat of the plague again delayed the opening of Parliament, this time until Tuesday 5\u00a0November. Fawkes left the country for a short time.

More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it. The final three conspirators were recruited in late 1605. At Michaelmas, Catesby persuaded the staunchly Catholic Ambrose Rookwood to rent Clopton House near Stratford-upon-Avon. Rookwood was a young man with recusant connections, whose stable of horses at Coldham Hall in Stanningfield, Suffolk was an important factor in his enlistment. His parents, Robert Rookwood and Dorothea Drury, were wealthy landowners, and had educated their son at a Jesuit school near Calais. Everard Digby was a young man who was generally well liked, and lived at Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire. He had been knighted by the King in April 1603, and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard. Digby and his wife, Mary Mulshaw, had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage, and the two men were reportedly close friends. Digby was asked by Catesby to rent Coughton Court near Alcester. Digby also promised \u00a31,500 after Percy failed to pay the rent due for the properties he had taken in Westminster. Finally, on 14\u00a0October Catesby invited Francis Tresham into the conspiracy. Tresham was the son of the Catholic Thomas Tresham, and a cousin to Robert Catesby\u2014the two had been raised together.

Catesby also apparently asked for \u00a32,000, and the use of Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire.

Monteagle's servant, Thomas Ward, had family connections with the Wright brothers, and sent a message to Catesby about the betrayal. Catesby, who had been due to go hunting with the King, suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator. Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, but urged them to abandon the plot.

The following day members of the Privy Council visited the King at the Palace of Whitehall and informed him that, based on the information that Salisbury had given them a week earlier, on Monday the Lord Chamberlain Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk would undertake a search of the Houses of Parliament, \"both above and below\". On Sunday 3\u00a0November Percy, Catesby and Wintour had a final meeting, where Percy told his colleagues that they should \"abide the uttermost triall\", and reminded them of their ship waiting at anchor on the Thames.

They left to report their findings, at which time Fawkes also left the building. The mention of Percy's name aroused further suspicion as he was already known to the authorities as a Catholic agitator. The King insisted that a more thorough search be undertaken. Late that night, the search party, headed by Thomas Knyvet, returned to the undercroft. They again found Fawkes, dressed in a cloak and hat, and wearing boots and spurs. He was arrested, whereupon he gave his name as John Johnson.

Hera, after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from Olympus to Argos and made the wife of Sthenelus (son of Perseus) give birth to Eurystheus after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles.
