Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured. In 1889, Tyrrell's colleague Thomas Chesmer Weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby. The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species \"Laelaps incrassatus\" by Edward Drinker Cope in 1892, although the name \"Laelaps\" was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to \"Dryptosaurus\" in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh. Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh. However, Lawrence Lambe used the name \"Dryptosaurus incrassatus\" instead of \"Laelaps incrassatus\" when he described the remains in detail in 1903 and 1904, a combination first coined by Oliver Perry Hay in 1902. Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that \"D. incrassatus\" was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth, so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species. The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of \"D. aquilunguis\", type species of \"Dryptosaurus\", so Osborn created the new name \"Albertosaurus sarcophagus\" for them in 1905.

This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of senescence. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, African buffalo, and rhinoceros. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids.

Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower. Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than adult \"Albertosaurus\" in mass.

Thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions, based on the macro arguments. This could be used to generate record-style data structures or \"unrolled\" loops, for example, or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters. For instance, a \"sort\" macro could accept the specification of a complex sort key and generate code crafted for that specific key, not needing the run-time tests that would be required for a general procedure interpreting the specification. An organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher-level language, since such programmers are not working with a computer's lowest-level conceptual elements.

Alcott continued to struggle financially for most of his life. Nevertheless, he continued focusing on educational projects and opened a new school at the end of his life in 1879.

His parents were Joseph Chatfield Alcott and Anna Bronson Alcott. The family home was in an area known as Spindle Hill, and his father, Joseph Alcox, traced his ancestry to colonial-era settlers in eastern Massachusetts. The family originally spelled their name \"Alcock\", later changed to \"Alcocke\" then \"Alcox\". Amos Bronson, the oldest of eight children, later changed the spelling to \"Alcott\" and dropped his first name.\nAt age six, young Bronson began his formal education in a one-room schoolhouse in the center of town but learned how to read at home with the help of his mother. The school taught only reading, writing, and spelling and he left this school at the age of 10. At age 13, his uncle, Reverend Tillotson Bronson, invited Alcott into his home in Cheshire, Connecticut, to be educated and prepared for college. Bronson gave it up after only a month and was self-educated from then on. He was not particularly social and his only close friend was his neighbor and second cousin William Alcott, with whom he shared books and ideas. Bronson Alcott later reflected on his childhood at Spindle Hill: \"It kept me pure... I dwelt amidst the hills... God spoke to me while I walked the fields.\" Starting at age 15, he took a job working for clockmaker Seth Thomas in the nearby town of Plymouth.", "qas": []}, {"context": "At age 17, Alcott passed the exam for a teaching certificate but had trouble finding work as a teacher. Instead, he left home and became a traveling salesman in the American South, peddling books and merchandise. He hoped the job would earn him enough money to support his parents, \"to make their cares, and burdens less... and get them free from debt\", though he soon spent most of his earnings on a new suit. At first, he thought it an acceptable occupation but soon worried about his spiritual well-being. In March 1823, Alcott wrote to his brother: \"Peddling is a hard place to serve God, but a capital one to serve Mammon.\" Near the end of his life, he fictionalized this experience in his book, \"New Connecticut\", originally circulated only among friends before its publication in 1881.", "qas": []}, {"context": "By the summer of 1823, Alcott returned to Connecticut in debt to his father, who bailed him out after his last two unsuccessful sales trips. He took a job as a schoolteacher in Cheshire with the help of his Uncle Tillotson. He quickly set about reforming the school. He added backs to the benches on which students sat, improved lighting and heating, de-emphasized rote learning, and provided individual slates to each student\u2014paid for by himself. Alcott had been influenced by educational philosophy of the Swiss pedagogue Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and even renamed his school \"The Cheshire Pestalozzi School\". His style attracted the attention of Samuel Joseph May, who introduced Alcott to his sister Abby May. She called him, \"an intelligent, philosophic, modest man\" and found his views on education \"very attractive\". Locals in Cheshire were less supportive and became suspicious of his methods. Many students left and were enrolled in the local common school or a recently re-opened private school for boys. On November 6, 1827, Alcott started teaching in Bristol, Connecticut, still using the same methods he used in Cheshire, but opposition from the community surfaced quickly; he was unemployed by March 1828. He moved to Boston on April 24, 1828, and was immediately impressed, referring to the city as a place \"where the light of the sun of righteousness has risen\". He opened the Salem Street Infant School two months later on June 23. Abby May applied as his teaching assistant; instead, the couple were engaged, without consent of the family. They were married at King's Chapel on May 22, 1830; he was 30 years old and she was 29. Her brother conducted the ceremony and a modest reception followed at her father's house. After their marriage the Alcotts moved to 12 Franklin Street in Boston, a boarding house run by a Mrs. Newall. Around this time, Alcott also first expressed his public disdain for slavery. In November 1830, he and William Lloyd Garrison founded what he later called a \"preliminary Anti-Slavery Society\", though he differed from Garrison as a nonresistant.

Alcott and Russell were initially concerned that the area would not be conducive to their progressive approach to education and considered establishing the school in nearby Philadelphia instead. Unsuccessful, they went back to Germantown, though the rent-free home was no longer available and the Alcotts instead had to rent rooms in a boarding-house.

Mary Peabody Mann served as a French instructor for a time. The school was briefly famous, and then infamous, because of his original methods. Before 1830, writing (except in higher education) equated to rote drills in the rules of grammar, spelling, vocabulary, penmanship and transcription of adult texts. However, in that decade, progressive reformers such as Alcott, influenced by Pestalozzi as well as Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel and Johann Friedrich Herbart, began to advocate writing about subjects from students' personal experiences. Reformers debated against beginning instruction with rules and were in favor of helping students learn to write by expressing the personal meaning of events within their own lives. Alcott's plan was to develop self-instruction on the basis of self-analysis, with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill, which were prevalent in the U.S. classrooms of the time. Alongside writing and reading, he gave lessons in \"spiritual culture\", which included interpretation of the Gospels, and advocated \"object teaching\" in writing instruction.

The school's founder, James Pierpont Greaves, had only recently died but Alcott was invited to stay there for a week. Alcott persuaded them to come to the United States with him; Lane and his son moved into the Alcott house and helped with family chores. Persuaded in part by Lane's abolitionist views, Alcott took a stand against the John Tyler administration's plan to annex Texas as a slave territory and refused to pay his poll tax. Abby May wrote in her journal on January 17, 1843, \"A day of some excitement, as Mr. Alcott refused to pay his town tax... After waiting some time to be committed [to jail], he was told it was paid by a friend.

The incident inspired Henry David Thoreau, whose similar protest led to a night in jail and his essay \"Civil Disobedience\".

Up front, he paid $1,500 of the total $1,800 value of the property; the rest was meant to be paid by the Alcotts over a two-year period. They moved to the farm on June 1 and optimistically named it \"Fruitlands\" despite only ten old apple trees on the property.

Calling themselves a \"consociate family\", they agreed to follow a strict vegetarian diet and to till the land without the use of animal labor. After some difficulty, they relented and allowed some cattle to be \"enslaved\". They also banned coffee, tea, alcoholic drinks, milk, and warm bathwater.

As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in first person, admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in \"Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America\" considers \"Amazing Grace\" an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective. Several of Newton's hymns were recognized as great work (\"Amazing Grace\" was not among them) while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write.

However, Newton became an ardent and outspoken abolitionist after he left Olney in the 1780s; he never connected the construction of the hymn that became \"Amazing Grace\" to anti-slavery sentiments. The lyrics in \"Olney Hymns\" were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective. For Newton, the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on one's spiritual progress.

Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratefulness for God's guidance, that God is involved in the daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await. Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly, and was humbled by it.

Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \"Amazing Grace\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \"New Britain\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\"Gallaher\" and \"St. Mary\") first published in the \"Columbian Harmony\" by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \"Gallaher\" and \"St. Mary\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \"St. Mary\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.", "qas": [{"question": "what is the name of the text that is used in olney ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns"}], "id": "(21, 23, 0)", "distractors": ["\"new britain\"", "st. mary", "\"st. mary"]}]}, {"context": "\"Amazing Grace\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \"New Britain\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook \"Southern Harmony\" in 1847.

Simultaneously, the U.S. began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness. The \"dangers, toils, and snares\" of Newton's lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for Americans. This became poignantly true during the most serious test of American cohesion in the U.S. Civil War (1861\u20131865). \"Amazing Grace\" set to \"New Britain\" was included in two hymnals distributed to soldiers and with death so real and imminent, religious services in the military became commonplace.

Moody's preaching and Sankey's musical gifts were significant; their arrangements were the forerunners of gospel music, and churches all over the U.S. were eager to acquire them. Moody and Sankey began publishing their compositions in 1875, and \"Amazing Grace\" appeared three times with three different melodies, but they were the first to give it its title; hymns were typically published using the first line of the lyrics, or the name of the tune such as \"New Britain\". A publisher named Edwin Othello Excell gave the version of \"Amazing Grace\" set to \"New Britain\" immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches. Excell altered some of Walker's music, making it more contemporary and European, giving \"New Britain\" some distance from its rural folk-music origins. Excell's version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs. Several editions featuring Newton's first three stanzas and the verse previously included by Harriet Beecher Stowe in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" were published by Excell between 1900 and 1910, and his version of \"Amazing Grace\" became the standard form of the song in American churches.", "qas": []}, {"context": "With the advent of recorded music and radio, \"Amazing Grace\" began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences.

AllMusic lists over 1,000 recordings \u2013 including re-releases and compilations \u2013 as of 2019. Its first recording is an a cappella version from 1922 by the Sacred Harp Choir. It was included from 1926 to 1930 in Okeh Records' catalogue, which typically concentrated strongly on blues and jazz. Demand was high for black gospel recordings of the song by H. R. Tomlin and J. M. Gates. A poignant sense of nostalgia accompanied the recordings of several gospel and blues singers in the 1940s and 1950s who used the song to remember their grandparents, traditions, and family roots. It was recorded with musical accompaniment for the first time in 1930 by Fiddlin' John Carson, although to another folk hymn named \"At the Cross\", not to \"New Britain\". \"Amazing Grace\" is emblematic of several kinds of folk music styles, often used as the standard example to illustrate such musical techniques as lining out and call and response, that have been practiced in both black and white folk music.", "qas": [{"question": "what was the first type of music that was recorded ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Amazing Grace"}], "id": "(21, 29, 0)", "distractors": ["charles h. spilman", "jesus", "john husband"]}]}, {"context": "Mahalia Jackson's 1947 version received significant radio airplay, and as her popularity grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s, she often sang it at public events such as concerts at Carnegie Hall.

Anthony Heilbut, author of \"The Gospel Sound\", states that the \"dangers, toils, and snares\" of Newton's words are a \"universal testimony\" of the African American experience. During the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War, the song took on a political tone. Mahalia Jackson employed \"Amazing Grace\" for Civil Rights marchers, writing that she used it \"to give magical protection a charm to ward off danger, an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend\u00a0... I was not sure the magic worked outside the church walls\u00a0... in the open air of Mississippi. But I wasn't taking any chances.\" Folk singer Judy Collins, who knew the song before she could remember learning it, witnessed Fannie Lou Hamer leading marchers in Mississippi in 1964, singing \"Amazing Grace\". Collins also considered it a talisman of sorts, and saw its equal emotional impact on the marchers, witnesses, and law enforcement who opposed the civil rights demonstrators. According to fellow folk singer Joan Baez, it was one of the most requested songs from her audiences, but she never realized its origin as a hymn; by the time she was singing it in the 1960s she said it had \"developed a life of its own\".

Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to \"pull her through\" to recovery. It was recorded in St. Paul's, the chapel at Columbia University, chosen for the acoustics. She chose an \"a cappella\" arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: \"I didn't know what else to do about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought\u00a0... but sing 'Amazing Grace'.\" Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, remaining on the charts for 15 weeks, as if, she wrote, her fans had been \"waiting to embrace it\". In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts.

It topped the \"RPM\" national singles chart in Canada for three weeks, and rose as high as number 11 in the U.S. It is also a controversial instrumental, as it combined pipes with a military band.

Cash and his family sang it to themselves while they worked in the cotton fields following Jack's death.

It can also be sung to the theme from \"The Mickey Mouse Club\", as Garrison Keillor has observed. The hymn has been employed in several films, including \"Alice's Restaurant\", \"Coal Miner's Daughter\", and \"Silkwood\". It is referenced in the 2006 film \"Amazing Grace\", which highlights Newton's influence on the leading British abolitionist William Wilberforce, and in the upcoming film biography of Newton, \"Newton's Grace\". The 1982 science fiction film \"\" used \"Amazing Grace\" amid a context of Christian symbolism, to memorialize Mr. Spock following his death, but more practically, because the song has become \"instantly recognizable to many in the audience as music that sounds appropriate for a funeral\" according to a \"Star Trek\" scholar. Since 1954, when an organ instrumental of \"New Britain\" became a bestseller, \"Amazing Grace\" has been associated with funerals and memorial services. It has become a song that inspires hope in the wake of tragedy, becoming a sort of \"spiritual national anthem\" according to authors Mary Rourke and Emily Gwathmey. For example, President Barack Obama recited and then sang the hymn at the memorial service for Clementa Pinckney, one of the victims of the 2015 Charleston church shooting.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In recent years, the words of the hymn have been changed in some religious publications to downplay a sense of imposed self-loathing by its singers. The second line, \"That saved a wretch like me!\" has been rewritten as \"That saved and strengthened me\", \"save a soul like me\", or \"that saved and set me free\". Kathleen Norris in her book \"Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith\" characterizes this transformation of the original words as \"wretched English\" making the line that replaces the original \"laughably bland\". Part of the reason for this change has been the altered interpretations of what wretchedness and grace means. Newton's Calvinistic view of redemption and divine grace formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was unable to change his life or be redeemed without God's help. Yet his lyrical subtlety, in Steve Turner's opinion, leaves the hymn's meaning open to a variety of Christian and non-Christian interpretations. \"Wretch\" also represents a period in Newton's life when he saw himself outcast and miserable, as he was when he was enslaved in Sierra Leone; his own arrogance was matched by how far he had fallen in his life.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The communal understanding of redemption and human self-worth has changed since Newton's time. Since the 1970s, self-help books, psychology, and some modern expressions of Christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong enough to find it: something to achieve. In contrast to Newton's vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from God, wretchedness has instead come to mean an obstacle of physical, social, or spiritual nature to overcome in order to achieve a state of grace, happiness, or contentment. Since its immense popularity and iconic nature, \"grace\" and the meaning behind the words of \"Amazing Grace\" have become as individual as the singer or listener. Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of \"Amazing Grace\" is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins \"When we've been there ten thousand years\"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God. \"Grace\", however, to John Newton had a clearer meaning, as he used the word to represent God or the power of God.", "qas": [{"question": "what did john newton use to represent god or the power of god ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Grace"}], "id": "(21, 37, 5)", "distractors": ["bruce hindmarsh", "cincinnati", "americans"]}]}, {"context": "The transformative power of the song was investigated by journalist Bill Moyers in a documentary released in 1990.

James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose \"Amazing Grace\" to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: \"there is a transformative power that is applicable\u00a0... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Moyers interviewed Collins, Cash, opera singer Jessye Norman, Appalachian folk musician Jean Ritchie and her family, white Sacred Harp singers in Georgia, black Sacred Harp singers in Alabama, and a prison choir at the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville.

Norman, who once notably sang it at the end of a large outdoor rock concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday, stated, \"I don't know whether it's the text I don't know whether we're talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people or whether it's that tune that everybody knows.\" A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: \"'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved\" by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realized he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison.

At the time, it was believed by some that the resurrection of the dead and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.

Both Dionysius and Bede regarded \"Anno Domini\" as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but \"the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25\" (\"Annunciation style\").\nOn the continent of Europe, \"Anno Domini\" was introduced as the era of choice of the Carolingian Renaissance by the English cleric and scholar Alcuin in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor Charlemagne and his successors popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the Carolingian Empire ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence.

In his books \"Becoming Animal\" and \"The Spell of the Sensuous,\" Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively \"solicit our attention\" or \"call our focus,\" coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain, enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us. In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us\u2014we 'see what they say'\u2014much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. \"To tell the story in this manner\u2014to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around\u2014is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection.

According to Mircea Eliade, shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters supernatural realms or dimensions to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment. Abram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman's role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies \u2014 the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds and weather patterns, all of whom are felt to have their own specific sentience).

In animist world-views, non-human animals are understood to participate in kinship systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies. Harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a powwow held by the Conne River Mi'kmaq in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, circling over the central drum group.

Each concerto is associated with a sonnet, possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music.

The following year, another \"serenata\", \"La Sena festeggiante\" (RV 694), was written for and premiered at the French embassy as well, celebrating the birth of the French royal princesses, Henriette and Louise \u00c9lisabeth. Vivaldi's Opus 9, \"La cetra\", was dedicated to Emperor Charles VI. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting Trieste to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of knight, a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of \"La cetra\", a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9.

The first, called Persian Imperial authorisation, is that the post-Exilic community devised the Torah as a legal basis on which to function within the Persian Imperial system; the second is that Pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for who would belong to the post Exilic Jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups, notably the priesthood and the lay \"elders\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Nevertheless, the completion of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post-Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones \u2013 the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions.

Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke \"somewhat as a voice in the wilderness,\" Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.\nSeamans' establishment of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision. This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR\u2014as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work\u2014played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR.

Though the only accounts of his lectures seem to show a sort of eccentric style and approach, he was said to have been good friends with many other masters at the school in Paris, and taught there, as well as some time in southern France, into his old age.

Among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the Latin literature of the Middle Ages; one of these, the \"De planctu naturae\", is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity. He created the allegory of grammatical \"conjugation\" which was to have its successors throughout the Middle Ages.

In this work, Alan uses prose and verse to illustrate the way in which nature defines its own position as inferior to that of God. He also attempts to illustrate the way in which humanity, through sexual perversion and specifically homosexuality, has defiled itself from nature and God. In \"Anticlaudianus\", another of his notable works, Alan uses a poetical dialogue to illustrate the way in which nature comes to the realization of her failure in producing the perfect man. She has only the ability to create a soulless body, and thus she is \"persuaded to undertake the journey to heaven to ask for a soul,\" and \"the Seven Liberal Arts produce a chariot for her... the Five Senses are the horses\". The \"Anticlaudianus\" was translated into French and German in the following century, and toward 1280 was re-worked into a musical anthology by Adam de la Bass\u00e9e. One of Alan's most popular and widely distributed works is his manual on preaching, \"Ars Praedicandi\", or \"The Art of Preaching\".

He owned some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position. His mother was from a middle-class English family from Hertford, north of London. When Wallace was five years old, his family moved to Hertford. There he attended Hertford Grammar School until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in 1836, when he was aged 14.\nWallace then moved to London to board with his older brother John, a 19-year-old apprentice builder. This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor.

In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper \"On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species\" of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time.

On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term \"natural selection\", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish.

Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community. The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries; but, with Darwin's publication of \"On the Origin of Species\" later in 1859, its significance became apparent.

Wallace responded that he and Henry Bates had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by John Jenner Weir that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. \"Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight\", Wallace wrote back to Darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a subsequent meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic. In 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea. Warning coloration was one of a number of contributions Wallace made in the area of the evolution of animal coloration in general and the concept of protective coloration in particular. It was also part of a lifelong disagreement Wallace had with Darwin over the importance of sexual selection. In his 1878 book \"Tropical Nature and Other Essays\", he wrote extensively on the coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases Darwin had attributed to sexual selection. He revisited the topic at length in his 1889 book \"Darwinism\". In 1890, he wrote a critical review in \"Nature\" of his friend Edward Bagnall Poulton's \"The Colours of Animals\" which supported Darwin on sexual selection, attacking especially Poulton's claims on the \"aesthetic preferences of the insect world\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "In 1889, Wallace wrote the book \"Darwinism\", which explained and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In 1864, Wallace published a paper, \"The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced from the Theory of 'Natural Selection'\", applying the theory to humankind. Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although Thomas Huxley had in \"Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature\". He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not \"regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape\". He saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the \"recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life. Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that\u00a0... with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain, bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded.\" For this paper he won Darwin's praise.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Shortly afterwards, Wallace became a spiritualist. At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in \"the unseen universe of Spirit\" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the raison d'\u00eatre of the universe was the development of the human spirit. These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that sexual selection could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas. Reaction to Wallace's ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied. Charles Lyell endorsed Wallace's views on human evolution rather than Darwin's. Wallace's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were critical of Wallace. As the historian of science Michael Shermer has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy, which were that evolution was not teleological (purpose driven) and that it was not anthropocentric (human-centred). Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes, that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled \"The World of Life\", which he later expanded into a book of the same name; a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period.

He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time. He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification. Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds\u2014which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution\u2014to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the zoogeographic regions still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. These included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently connecting North America and South America) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, \"The Geographical Distribution of Animals\", was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on zoogeography for the next 80 years.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In this book Wallace did not confine himself to the biogeography of living species, but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that tapirs had originated in the Northern Hemisphere, migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia. Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the mass extinction of megafauna in the late Pleistocene. In \"The Geographical Distribution of Animals\" (1876) he wrote, \"We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared\".

It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like Madagascar) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased glaciation, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages. \"Island Life\" was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Wallace's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world.

Among other things, Wallace pointed out that spectroscopic analysis had shown no signs of water vapour in the Martian atmosphere, that Lowell's analysis of Mars's climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet-girding irrigation system, impossible.

For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some s\u00e9ance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fianc\u00e9e broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism.

In his chapter entitled 'Modern Spiritualism: Evidence of Men of Science', Wallace refers to \"three men of the highest eminence in their respective departments\" who were Professor De Morgan, Professor Hare and Judge Edmonds who all investigated spiritualist phenomena. However, Wallace himself is only quoting their results and was not present at any of their investigations. His vehement defence of spiritualism strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as Henry Bates, Thomas Huxley, and even Darwin, who felt he was overly credulous. Evidence of this can be seen in Wallace's letters dated 22 November and 1 December 1866, to Thomas Huxley asking him if he would be interested in getting involved in scientific spiritualist investigations which Huxley, politely but emphatically, declined on the basis that he had neither the time nor the inclination. Others, such as the physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter and zoologist E. Ray Lankester became openly and publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism, notably William Crookes, were subject to much criticism from the press, with \"The Lancet\" as the leading English medical journal of the time being particularly harsh.

Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10\u00a0km) stretch of canal.

When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments.

The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, \"Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime\", attacking the commission's findings.
