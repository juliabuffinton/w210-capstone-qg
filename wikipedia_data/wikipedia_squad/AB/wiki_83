Fission also produces iodine-135, which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the \"iodine pit.\" If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a \"xenon burnoff (power) transient\".

When the United States demonstrated that it had nuclear power capabilities after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Russians started to develop their program in preparation for the Cold War. With the Russian military buildup, France and the United Kingdom perceived this as a security threat and therefore they pursued nuclear weapons (Sagan, pg 71). Even though proliferation causes proliferation, this does not guarantee that other states will successfully develop nuclear weapons because the economic stability of a state plays an important role on whether the state will successfully be able to acquire nuclear weapons.

The fire ultimately devastated the region burning the world's largest boreal forest, the size of Germany.

One of these areas of contention, as elucidated by Lynn R. Anspaugh, is upon the question of which season should be used as the backdrop for the US-USSR war models, as most models choose the summer in the Northern Hemisphere as the start point to produce the maximum soot lofting and therefore eventual winter effect, whereas it has been pointed out that if the firestorms occurred in the autumn or winter months, when there is much less intense sunlight to loft soot into a stable region of the stratosphere, the magnitude of the cooling effect from the same number of firestorms as ignited in the summer models, would be negligible according to a January model run by Covey et al.

In a similar vein, in 1989 Carl Sagan and Richard Turco wrote a policy implications paper that appeared in \"AMBIO\" that suggested that as nuclear winter is a \"well-established prospect\", both superpowers should jointly reduce their nuclear arsenals to \"Canonical Deterrent Force\" levels of 100\u2013300 individual warheads each, such that in \"the event of nuclear war [this] would minimize the likelihood of [extreme] nuclear winter.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "An originally classified 1984 US interagency intelligence assessment states that in both the preceding 1970s and 80s, the Soviet and US military were already following the \"\"existing trends\"\" in warhead miniaturization, of higher accuracy and lower yield nuclear warheads, this is seen when assessing the most numerous physics packages in the US arsenal, which in the 1960s were the B28 and W31, however both quickly became less prominent with the 1970s mass production runs of the 50 Kt W68, the 100 Kt W76 and in the 1980s, with the B61. This trend towards miniaturization, enabled by advances in inertial guidance and accurate GPS navigation etc., was motivated by a multitude of factors, namely the desire to leverage the physics of equivalent megatonnage that miniaturization offered; of freeing up space to fit more MIRV warheads and decoys on each missile. Alongside the desire to still destroy hardened targets but while reducing the severity of fallout collateral damage depositing on neighboring, and potentially friendly, countries. As it relates to the likelihood of nuclear winter, the range of potential thermal radiation ignited fires was already reduced with miniaturization. For example, the most popular nuclear winter paper, the 1983 TTAPS paper, had described a 3000 Mt counterforce attack on ICBM sites with each individual warhead having approximately one Mt of energy; however not long after publication, Michael Altfeld of Michigan State University and political scientist Stephen Cimbala of Pennsylvania State University argued that the then already developed and deployed smaller, more accurate warheads (e.g. W76), together with lower detonation heights, could produce the same counterforce strike with a total of only 3 Mt of energy being expended. They continue that, \"if\" the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the target list, as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts, would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings, while also temporarily lofting far more localized fallout when compared to airburst fuzing \u2013 the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets. This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 \"Interagency Intelligence assessment\", which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of burst, timing and other factors to reduce the amount of smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter. Therefore, as a consequence of attempting to limit the target fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for surface and sub-surface bursts, this will result in a scenario where the far more concentrated, and therefore deadlier, \"local\" fallout that is generated following a surface burst forms, as opposed to the comparatively dilute \"global\" fallout created when nuclear weapons are fuzed in air burst mode.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Altfeld and Cimbala also argued that belief in the possibility of nuclear winter would actually make nuclear war more likely, contrary to the views of Sagan and others, because it would serve yet further motivation to follow the \"existing trends\", towards the development of more accurate, and even lower explosive yield, nuclear weapons. As the winter hypothesis suggests that the replacement of the then Cold War viewed strategic nuclear weapons in the multi-megaton yield range, with weapons of explosive yields closer to tactical nuclear weapons, such as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), would safeguard against the nuclear winter potential. With the latter capabilities of the then, largely still conceptual RNEP, specifically cited by the influential nuclear warfare analyst Albert Wohlstetter.

The other main classes are amino acids (monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins), carbohydrates (which includes the polysaccharides), the nucleic acids (which include DNA and RNA as polymers), and the lipids. In addition, animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the Krebs cycle, and produces isoprene, the most common hydrocarbon in animals. Isoprenes in animals form the important steroid structural (cholesterol) and steroid hormone compounds; and in plants form terpenes, terpenoids, some alkaloids, and a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer polyisoprenoids present in the latex of various species of plants, which is the basis for making rubber.", "qas": []}, {"context": "\nIn pharmacology, an important group of organic compounds is small molecules, also referred to as 'small organic compounds'.

In reality, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald had assigned this selection process to the Executive Branch of the Government, as previous attempts to arrive at a consensus had ended in deadlock. The \"Queen's choice\" turned out to be the small frontier town of Ottawa for two main reasons: Firstly, Ottawa's isolated location in a back country surrounded by dense forest far from the Canada\u2013US border and situated on a cliff face would make it more defensible from attack. Secondly, Ottawa was approximately midway between Toronto and Kingston (in Canada West) and Montreal and Quebec City (in Canada East). Additionally, despite Ottawa's regional isolation it had seasonal water transportation access to Montreal over the Ottawa River and to Kingston via the Rideau Waterway. By 1854 it also had a modern all season Bytown and Prescott Railway that carried passengers, lumber and supplies the 82-kilometres to Prescott on the Saint Lawrence River and beyond. Ottawa's small size, it was thought, would make it less prone to rampaging politically motivated mobs, as had happened in the previous Canadian capitals. The government already owned the land that would eventually become Parliament Hill which they thought would be an ideal location for the Parliament Buildings. Ottawa was the only settlement of any substantial size that was already directly on the border of French populated former Lower Canada and English populated former Upper Canada thus additionally making the selection an important political compromise.

An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it.\" As Objectivist philosopher Leonard Peikoff argued, Rand's argument for axioms \"is not a proof that the axioms of existence, consciousness, and identity are true.

The axiom of existence is grasped in differentiating something from nothing, while the law of identity is grasped in differentiating one thing from another, i.e., one's first awareness of the law of non-contradiction, another crucial base for the rest of knowledge.

Other writers have explored the application of Objectivism to fields ranging from art, as in \"What Art Is\" by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kamhi (2000), to teleology, as in \"The Biological Basis of Teleological Concepts\" by Harry Binswanger (1990).", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to one Rand biographer, most people first read Rand's works in their \"formative years.\" Rand's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nathaniel Branden referred to Rand's \"especially powerful appeal to the young,\" while Onkar Ghate of the Ayn Rand Institute said Rand \"appeals to the idealism of youth.\" This appeal has alarmed a number of critics of the philosophy. Many of these young people later abandon their positive view of Rand and are often said to have \"outgrown\" her ideas. Supporters of Rand's work recognize the phenomenon, but attribute it to the loss of youthful idealism and inability to resist social pressures for intellectual conformity. In contrast, historian Jennifer Burns, writing in \"Goddess of the Market\" (2009), says some critics \"dismiss Rand as a shallow thinker appealing only to adolescents,\" although she thinks the critics \"miss her significance\" as a \"gateway drug\" to right-wing politics.", "qas": [{"question": "what was one of the first readers first read ?", "answers": [], "id": "(34, 49, 0)"}]}, {"context": "Academic philosophers have generally dismissed Objectivism since Rand first presented it. Objectivism has been called \"fiercely anti-academic\" because of Rand's criticism of contemporary intellectuals. David Sidorsky, a professor of moral and political philosophy at Columbia University, says Rand's work is \"outside the mainstream\" and is more of an ideological movement than a well-grounded philosophy. British philosopher Ted Honderich notes that he deliberately excluded an article on Rand from \"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy\" (Rand is, however, mentioned in the article on popular philosophy by Anthony Quinton). Rand is the subject of entries in the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", \"The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers\", the \"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", \"The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers\", and \"The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy\". An entry about Rand by Chandran Kukathas in the \"Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" says, \"The influence of Rand's ideas was strongest among college students in the USA but attracted little attention from academic philosophers.\" Kukathas also says her defenses of capitalism and selfishness \"kept her out of the intellectual mainstream\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "In recent decades Rand's works are more likely to be encountered in the classroom. The Ayn Rand Society, dedicated to fostering the scholarly study of Objectivism, is affiliated with the American Philosophical Association's Eastern Division. Aristotle scholar and Objectivist Allan Gotthelf, late chairman of the Society, and his colleagues argued for more academic study of Objectivism, viewing the philosophy as a unique and intellectually interesting defense of classical liberalism that is worth debating. In 1999, a refereed \"Journal of Ayn Rand Studies\" began. Programs and fellowships for the study of Objectivism have been supported at the University of Pittsburgh, University of Texas at Austin and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.", "qas": [{"question": "what is more likely to be seen in the course ?", "answers": [], "id": "(34, 51, 0)"}]}, {"context": "", "qas": []}, {"context": "", "qas": []}]}], "version": 1.0}
