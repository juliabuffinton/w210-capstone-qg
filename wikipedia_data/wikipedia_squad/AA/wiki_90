Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to presbyteries and further to a general assembly. Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members.

In their arguments, this is particularly demonstrated in the Council of Jerusalem, described in Acts chapter 15, where the Apostles and elders gathered together to govern the Church; the Apostles being representatives of the universal Church, and elders being such for the local church.

Beyond this the precise division of power varies from one nation to another.\nThe constitutions of Germany and the United States provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries like Canada and India, on the other hand, state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility.

In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...\" This stems from the fact that states in the US maintain all sovereignty that they do not yield to the federation by their own consent.

The field uniform was often modified under the influence of the extremes of climate and terrain in which the Foreign Legion served. Shakos were soon replaced by the light cloth kepi, which was far more suitable for North African conditions. The practice of wearing heavy \"capotes\" (greatcoats) on the march and \"vestes\" (short hip-length jackets) as working dress in barracks was followed by the Foreign Legion from its establishment.\nOne short lived aberration was the wearing of green uniforms in 1856 by Foreign Legion units recruited in Switzerland for service in the Crimean War. In the Crimea itself (1854\u201359) a hooded coat and red or blue waist sashes were adopted for winter dress, while during the Mexican Intervention (1863\u201365) straw hats or sombreros were sometimes substituted for the kepi. When the latter was worn it was usually covered with a white \"havelock\" \u2013 the predecessor of the white kepi that was to become a symbol of the Foreign Legion. Foreign Legion units serving in France during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371 were distinguishable only by minor details of insignia from the bulk of the French infantry. However subsequent colonial campaigns saw an increasing use of special garments for hot weather wear such as collarless \"keo\" blouses in Tonkin 1884\u201385, khaki drill jackets in Dahomey (1892) and drab covered topees worn with all-white fatigue dress in Madagascar (1895).", "qas": []}, {"context": "In the early 20th century the legionnaire wore a red kepi with blue band and piping, dark blue tunic with red collar, red cuff patches, and red trousers.

In the field a light khaki cover was worn over the kepi, sometimes with a protective neck curtain attached. The standard medium-blue double breasted greatcoat (\"capote\") of the French infantry was worn, usually buttoned back to free the legs for marching. From the 1830s the legionnaires had worn a broad blue woollen sash around the waist, like other European units of the French Army of Africa (such as the Zouaves or the Chasseurs d'Afrique), while indigenous units of the Army of Africa (spahis and tirailleurs) wore red sashes.

It later became particularly identified with the Foreign Legion as the unit most likely to serve at remote frontier posts (other than locally recruited tirailleurs who wore fezzes or turbans). The variances of climate in North Africa led the French Army to the sensible expedient of letting local commanders decide on the appropriate \"tenue de jour\" (uniform of the day) according to circumstances. Thus a legionnaire might parade or walk out in blue tunic and white trousers in hot weather, blue tunic and red trousers in normal temperatures or wear the blue greatcoat with red trousers under colder conditions. The sash could be worn with greatcoat, blouse or veste but not with the tunic. Epaulettes were a detachable dress item worn only with tunic or greatcoat for parade or off duty wear.\nOfficers wore the same dark blue (almost black) tunics as those of their colleagues in the French line regiments, except that black replaced red as a facing colour on collar and cuffs. Gold fringed epaulettes were worn for full dress and rank was shown by the number of gold rings on both kepi and cuffs. Trousers were red with black stripes or white according to occasion or conditions. All-white or light khaki uniforms (from as early as the 1890s) were often worn in the field or for ordinary duties in barracks.

The basic points of the argument, made by physicists Enrico Fermi (1901\u20131954) and Michael H. Hart (born 1932), are:\nAccording to this line of reasoning, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial aliens. In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this, leading him to ask, \"Where is everybody?\" There have been many attempts to explain the Fermi paradox, primarily either suggesting that intelligent extraterrestrial life is extremely rare or proposing reasons that such civilizations have not contacted or visited Earth.\nThe Fermi paradox is a conflict between the argument that scale and probability seem to favor intelligent life being common in the universe, and a total lack of evidence of intelligent life having ever arisen anywhere other than on the Earth.", "qas": [{"question": "what is a conflict between ?", "answers": [], "id": "(35, 0, 4)"}, {"question": "who is the fermi theorem ?", "answers": [], "id": "(35, 0, 0)"}]}, {"context": "The first aspect of the Fermi paradox is a function of the scale or the large numbers involved: there are an estimated 200\u2013400 billion stars in the Milky Way (2\u20134 \u00d7 10) and 70 sextillion (7\u00d710) in the observable universe. Even if intelligent life occurs on only a minuscule percentage of planets around these stars, there might still be a great number of civilizations, and if the percentage were high enough it would produce a significant number of extant civilizations in the Milky Way. This assumes the mediocrity principle, by which the Earth is a typical planet.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The second aspect of the Fermi paradox is the argument of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible that at least some civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe, of other intelligent life after 13.8\u00a0billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution.

This is relatively brief on a geological scale, let alone a cosmological one. Since there are many stars older than the Sun, and since intelligent life might have evolved earlier elsewhere, the question then becomes why the galaxy has not been colonized already.

Even if such civilizations are rare, the scale argument indicates they should exist somewhere at some point during the history of the universe, and since they could be detected from far away over a considerable period of time, many more potential sites for their origin are within range of our observation.

The conversation shifted to other subjects, until during lunch Fermi suddenly exclaimed, \"Where are they?\" (alternatively, \"Where is everybody?\").

Conversely, Frank Tipler and John D. Barrow used pessimistic numbers and speculated that the average number of civilizations in a galaxy is much less than one. Almost all arguments involving the Drake equation suffer from the overconfidence effect, a common error of probabilistic reasoning about low-probability events, by guessing specific numbers for likelihoods of events whose mechanism is not yet understood, such as the likelihood of abiogenesis on an Earth-like planet, with current likelihood estimates varying over many hundreds of orders of magnitude. An analysis that takes into account some of the uncertainty associated with this lack of understanding has been carried out by Anders Sandberg, Eric Drexler and Toby Ord, and suggests that with very high probability, either intelligent civilizations are plentiful in our galaxy or humanity is alone in the observable universe, with the lack of observation of intelligent civilizations pointing towards the latter option.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The Great Filter, in the context of the Fermi paradox, is whatever prevents \"dead matter\" from giving rise, in time, to expanding, lasting life according to the Kardashev scale.

In December he attended Nekrasov's funeral and gave a speech. He was appointed an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, from which he received an honorary certificate in February 1879. He declined an invitation to an international congress on copyright in Paris after his son Alyosha had a severe epileptic seizure and died on 16 May.

Lang's fears would be realized following his departure from Austria, as under the Nuremberg Laws he would be identified as a Jew even though his mother was a converted Roman Catholic, and he was raised as such.", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to Lang, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels called Lang to his offices to inform him that \"The Testament of Dr Mabuse\" was being banned but that he was nevertheless so impressed by Lang's abilities as a filmmaker (especially \"Metropolis\"), he was offering Lang a position as the head of German film studio UFA. Lang had stated that it was during this meeting that he had decided to leave for Paris \u2013 but that the banks had closed by the time the meeting was over. Lang has stated that he fled that very evening. This statement has been found wrong after his passport of the time showed that he travelled a few times during 1933 to and from Germany, where he got his divorce from Thea von Harbou, who stayed behind, late in 1933.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Lang finally left Berlin on 31 July 1933, four months after his meeting with Goebbels and supposed dramatic escape. He moved to Paris.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In Paris, Lang filmed a version of Ferenc Moln\u00e1r's \"Liliom\", starring Charles Boyer. This was Lang's only film in French (not counting the French version of \"Testament\"). He then went to the United States.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In Hollywood, Lang signed first with MGM Studios. His first American film was the crime drama \"Fury\" (1936), which starred Spencer Tracy as a man who is wrongly accused of a crime and nearly killed when a lynch mob sets fire to the jail where he is awaiting trial. From the beginning Lang was struggling with restrictions in the US. Thus, in \"Fury\" he was not allowed to represent black victims in a lynching scenario or to criticize racism. Because of his anti-Nazi films and his acquaintance with Brecht and Hanns Eisler, he came into the field of view of the Communist hunter Joseph McCarthy.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Lang became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939. He made twenty-three features in his 20-year American career, working in a variety of genres at every major studio in Hollywood, and occasionally producing his films as an independent. Lang's American films were often compared unfavorably to his earlier works by contemporary critics, but the restrained Expressionism of these films is now seen as integral to the emergence and evolution of American genre cinema, \"film noir\" in particular. Lang's 1945 film \"Scarlet Street\" is considered a central film in the genre.", "qas": []}, {"context": "One of Lang's most famous \"films noir\" is the police drama \"The Big Heat\" (1953), noted for its uncompromising brutality, especially for a scene in which Lee Marvin throws scalding coffee on Gloria Grahame's face. As Lang's visual style simplified, in part due to the constraints of the Hollywood studio system, his worldview became increasingly pessimistic, culminating in the cold, geometric style of his last American films, \"While the City Sleeps\" (1956) and \"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\" (1956).", "qas": []}, {"context": "Finding it difficult to find congenial production conditions and backers in Hollywood, particularly as his health declined with age, Lang contemplated retirement. The German producer Artur Brauner had expressed interest in remaking \"The Indian Tomb\" (from an original story by Thea von Harbou, that Lang had developed in the 1920s which had ultimately been directed by Joe May). So Lang returned to Germany, to make his \"Indian Epic\" (consisting of \"The Tiger of Eschnapur\" and \"The Indian Tomb\"). Following the production, Brauner was preparing for a remake of \"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\" when Lang approached him with the idea of adding a new original film to the series. The result was \"The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse\" (1960), whose success led to a series of new Mabuse films, which were produced by Brauner (including the remake of \"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\"), though Lang did not direct any of the sequels. \"The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse\" can be viewed as the marriage between the director's early experiences with expressionist techniques in Germany with the spartan style already visible in his late American work. Lang was approaching blindness during the production, and it was his final project as director. In 1963, he appeared as himself in Jean-Luc Godard's film \"Contempt\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "On February 8, 1960, Lang received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture industry, located at 1600 Vine Street.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Lang died from a stroke in 1976 and was interred in the Forest Lawn \u2013 Hollywood Hills Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.", "qas": []}, {"context": "While his career had ended without fanfare, Lang's American and later German works were championed by the critics of the \"Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma\", such as Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and Jacques Rivette. Truffaut wrote that Lang, especially in his American career, was greatly underappreciated by \"cinema historians and critics\" who \"deny him any genius when he 'signs' spy movies ... war movies ... or simple thrillers.\" Filmmakers that were influenced by his work include Jacques Rivette and William Friedkin.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The Academy Film Archive has preserved a number of Lang's films, including \"Human Desire\", \"Man Hunt\", and \"The Art Director\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "", "qas": []}]}], "version": 1.0}
