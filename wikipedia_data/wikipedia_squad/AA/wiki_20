This increases total cache size of the processor and effectively makes caching behave as if there is a very large L1 cache with a slower region (the L2) and a very fast region (the L1). Because of Athlon's very large L1 cache and the exclusive design, which turns the L2 cache into basically a \"victim cache\", the need for high L2 performance and size was lessened. AMD kept the 64-bit L2 cache data bus from the older Athlons, as a result, and allowed it to have a relatively high latency.

Undervolting is a process of determining the lowest voltage at which a CPU can remain stable at a given clock speed.

One method of modification known as wire-modding involves connecting the appropriate CPU pins on the CPU socket with small lengths of wire to select the appropriate multiplier.

Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series' most powerful characters with small statures. Thompson concluded his analysis by saying that only Akira Toriyama drew like this at the time and that \"Dragon Ball\" is \"an action manga drawn by a gag manga artist.\" However, James S. Yadao, author of \"The Rough Guide to Manga\", points out that an art shift does occur in the series, as the characters gradually \"lose the rounded, innocent look that [Toriyama] established in \"Dr. Slump\" and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity.\"", "qas": [{"question": "who said that he was a reason for the dragon ?", "answers": [], "id": "(53, 19, 0)"}]}, {"context": "Thompson stated in 2011 that \"\"Dragon Ball\" is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every \"Sh\u014dnen Jump\" artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways.\" Many manga artists have named Toriyama and \"Dragon Ball\" as influences, including \"One Piece\" author Eiichiro Oda, \"Naruto\" creator Masashi Kishimoto, \"Fairy Tail\" and \"Rave\" author Hiro Mashima, \"Venus Versus Virus\" author Atsushi Suzumi, \"Bleach\" creator Tite Kubo, \"Black Cat\" author Kentaro Yabuki, and \"Mr. Fullswing\" author Shinya Suzuki.
