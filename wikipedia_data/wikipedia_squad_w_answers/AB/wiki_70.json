Derivation involves affixing bound (i.e. non-independent) forms to existing lexemes, whereby the addition of the affix derives a new lexeme. The word \"independent\", for example, is derived from the word \"dependent\" by using the prefix \"in-\", while \"dependent\" itself is derived from the verb \"depend\".

Instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word forms or to generate word forms from stems, word-based morphology states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflectional paradigms. The major point behind this approach is that many such generalizations are hard to state with either of the other approaches. Word-and-paradigm approaches are also well-suited to capturing purely morphological phenomena, such as morphomes. Examples to show the effectiveness of word-based approaches are usually drawn from fusional languages, where a given \"piece\" of a word, which a morpheme-based theory would call an inflectional morpheme, corresponds to a combination of grammatical categories, for example, \"third-person plural\". Morpheme-based theories usually have no problems with this situation since one says that a given morpheme has two categories. Item-and-process theories, on the other hand, often break down in cases like these because they all too often assume that there will be two separate rules here, one for third person, and the other for plural, but the distinction between them turns out to be artificial. The approaches treat these as whole words that are related to each other by analogical rules. Words can be categorized based on the pattern they fit into. This applies both to existing words and to new ones. Application of a pattern different from the one that has been used historically can give rise to a new word, such as \"older\" replacing \"elder\" (where \"older\" follows the normal pattern of adjectival superlatives) and \"cows\" replacing \"kine\" (where \"cows\" fits the regular pattern of plural formation).", "qas": []}, {"context": "In the 19th century, philologists devised a now classic classification of languages according to their morphology.

These pulses were included physically within pre-existing recordings on VHS and Betamax and were generated upon playback by a chip in DVD players and digital cable or satellite boxes. A DVD recorder receiving an analog signal featuring these pulses would detect them and display a message saying that the source is \"copy-protected\" followed by aborting the recording.

Apart from this, many DVD recorders mistake the mechanical instability of worn videotapes for Macrovision signals, and so refuse to make what would be perfectly legal DVD dubs of people's old home movies and the like. This widespread problem is another factor contributing to the demand for devices that defeat Macrovision. The signal has also been known to confuse home theater line doublers (devices for improving the quality of video for large projection TVs) and some high-end television comb filters.

Modafinil was screened at a large panel of receptors and transporters in an attempt to elucidate its pharmacology.

He held \"virtually as a matter of iron logic\" that in the event of conflict between the Constitution and statutory laws passed by Congress, the constitutional law must be supreme. Again borrowing from Federalist No. 78, Marshall stated:\nThird, Marshall stated that denying the supremacy of the Constitution over Congress's acts would mean that \"courts must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the law.\" He reasoned that this, in turn, would make Congress omnipotent, since none of the laws it passed would ever be invalid:\nMarshall then gave several other reasons in favor of judicial review. He argued that the authorization in Article III of the Constitution that the Court can decide cases arising \"under this Constitution\" implied that the Court had the power to strike down laws conflicting with the Constitution. This, Marshall wrote, meant that the Founders were willing to have the American judiciary use and interpret the Constitution when judging cases. Lastly, Marshall argued that judicial review is implied in Article VI of the Constitution, since it declares the supreme law of the United States to be not the Constitution and the laws of the United States in general, but rather the Constitution and laws made \"in Pursuance thereof\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Besides its inherent legal questions, the case of \"Marbury v. Madison\" also created a difficult political dilemma for Marshall and the rest of the Supreme Court. If the Court ruled in favor of Marbury and issued a writ of mandamus ordering Madison to deliver the commission, Jefferson and Madison would probably have simply ignored the order, which would have made the Court look impotent and emphasized the \"shakiness\" of the judiciary. On the other hand, a plain and simple ruling against Marbury would have given Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans a clear political victory.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Marshall solved both problems. First, he ruled that Madison's withholding of Marbury's commission was illegal, which gave the Federalists some comfort; but then, he said the Court could not give Marbury his requested writ of mandamus, giving Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans the result they desired. Having done so, Marshall maneuvered Marbury's simple petition for a writ of mandamus into a question that went to heart of American constitutional law itself in what the American constitutional law scholar Laurence Tribe described as \"an oft-told tale ... [that] remains awe-inspiring\". In his well-known history of the Supreme Court, the American political historian Robert G.

Though Jefferson criticized Marshall's opinion, he accepted it, and Marshall's decision in \"Marbury\" \"articulate[d] a role for the federal courts that survives to this day.\" In the words of the American legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky: \"The brilliance of Marshall's opinion cannot be overstated.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Given its preeminent position in American constitutional law, Marshall's opinion in \"Marbury v.

For example, American courts now generally follow the principle of \"constitutional avoidance\": if a certain interpretation of a law raises constitutional problems, they prefer to use alternative interpretations that avoid these problems. In \"Marbury\", Marshall could have avoided the constitutional questions through different legal rulings: for example, if he had ruled that Marbury did not have a right to his commission until it was delivered, or if he had ruled that refusals to honor political appointments could only be remedied through the political process and not the judicial process, the Court would not have reached the case's constitutional issues. Marshall did not do so, and many legal scholars have criticized him for it. However, others have noted that the \"constitutional avoidance\" principle did not exist in 1803, and in any case is \"only a general guide for Court action and not an ironclad precept.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Second, Marshall's arguments for the Court's authority are sometimes said to be mere \"assertions of authority\", rather than substantive reasons logically laid out to support his position. It is generally agreed that Marshall's series of assertions regarding the U.S. Constitution and the actions of the other branches of government do not \"inexorably lead to the conclusion that Marshall draws from them\". Marshall's assertion of the American judiciary's authority to review executive branch actions was the most controversial issue when \"Marbury\" was first decided, and several subsequent U.S. presidents have tried to dispute it, to varying degrees. However, the power of judicial review is now widely accepted and firmly established in American law.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Additionally, it is questionable whether Marshall should have participated in the \"Marbury\" case because of his participating role in the dispute. Marshall was still the acting Secretary of State when the nominations were made, and he himself had signed Marbury and the other men's commissions and had been responsible for their delivery. This potential conflict of interest raises strong grounds for Marshall to have recused himself from the case. In hindsight, the fact that Marshall did not recuse himself from \"Marbury\" is likely indicative of his eagerness to hear the case and use it to establish judicial review.", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"Marbury v. Madison\" remains the single most important decision in American constitutional law.

By the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, American courts' \"independent power and duty to interpret the law\" was well established. Nevertheless, Marshall's opinion in \"Marbury\" was the power's first announcement and exercise by the Supreme Court.

Halliday's model conceives grammar explicitly as how meanings are coded into wordings, in both spoken and written modes in all varieties and formal registers of a language. Three strands of grammar operate simultaneously. They concern: (i) the interpersonal exchange between speaker and listener, and writer and reader; (ii) representation of our outer and inner worlds; and (iii) the wording of these meanings in cohesive spoken and written texts, from within the clause up to whole texts. Notably, the grammar embraces intonation in spoken language. Halliday's seminal \"Introduction to Functional Grammar\" (first edition, 1985) spawned a new research discipline and related pedagogical approaches.

After 18 months' training, he spent a year in India working with the Chinese Intelligence Unit doing counter-intelligence work. In 1945 he was brought back to London to teach Chinese.

Having taught languages for 13 years, he changed his field of specialisation to linguistics, and developed systemic functional linguistics, including systemic functional grammar, elaborating on the foundations laid by his British teacher J.R.

Halliday's conception of grammar \u2013 or \"lexicogrammar\", a term he coined to argue that lexis and grammar are part of the same phenomenon \u2013 is based on a more general theory of language as a social semiotic resource, or \"meaning potential\" (see Systemic functional linguistics). Halliday follows Hjelmslev and Firth in distinguishing theoretical from descriptive categories in linguistics. He argues that \"theoretical categories, and their inter-relations, construe an abstract model of language ... they are interlocking and mutally defining. The theoretical architecture derives from work on the description of natural discourse, and as such 'no very clear line is drawn between '(theoretical) linguistics' and 'applied linguistics'\".

On Chomsky specifically, he writes that \"imaginary problems were created by the whole series of dichotomies that Chomsky introduced, or took over unproblematized: not only syntax/semantics but also grammar/lexis, language/thought, competence/performance. Once these dichotomies had been set up, the problem arose of locating and maintaining the boundaries between them.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Halliday's first major work on grammar was \"Categories of the theory of grammar\", in the journal \"Word\" in 1961.

These categories are \"of the highest order of abstraction\", but he defended them as necessary to \"make possible a coherent account of what grammar is and of its place in language\" In articulating unit, Halliday proposed the notion of a \"rank scale\". The units of grammar form a hierarchy, a scale from largest to smallest, which he proposed as: \"sentence\", \"clause\", \"group/phrase\", \"word\" and \"morpheme\". Halliday defined structure as \"likeness between events in successivity\" and as \"an arrangement of elements ordered in places\".

Halliday explains this preoccupation in the following way: \"It seemed to me that explanations of linguistic phenomena needed to be sought in relationships among systems rather than among structures \u2013 in what I once called \"deep paradigms\" \u2013 since these were essentially where speakers made their choices\". Halliday's \"systemic grammar\" is a semiotic account of grammar, because of this orientation to choice. Every linguistic act involves choice, and choices are made on many scales. Systemic grammars draw on system networks as their primary representation tool as a consequence. For instance, a major clause must display some structure that is the formal realization of a choice from the system of \"voice\", i.e. it must be either \"middle\" or \"effective\", where \"effective\" leads to the further choice of \"operative\" (otherwise known as 'active') or \"receptive\" (otherwise known as \"passive\").", "qas": []}, {"context": "Halliday's grammar is not just \"systemic\", but \"systemic functional\". He argues that the explanation of how language works \"needed to be grounded in a functional analysis, since language had evolved in the process of carrying out certain critical functions as human beings interacted with their ... 'eco-social' environment\". Halliday's early grammatical descriptions of English, called \"Notes on Transitivity and Theme in English \u2013 Parts 1\u20133\" include reference to \"four components in the grammar of English representing four functions that the language as a communication system is required to carry out: the experiential, the logical, the discoursal and the speech functional or interpersonal\". The \"discoursal\" function was renamed the \"textual function\". In this discussion of functions of language, Halliday draws on the work of B\u00fchler and Malinowski.

Halliday argues that language does not exist merely to reflect social structure. For instance, he writes:\nIn enumerating his claims about the trajectory of children's language development, Halliday eschews the metaphor of \"acquisition\", in which language is considered a static product which the child takes on when sufficient exposure to natural language enables \"parameter setting\".
